This code book indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

##Data transformation

The raw data sets are processed with run_analisys.R script to create a tidy data set.

##The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

    mean(): Mean value
    std(): Standard deviation
    mad(): Median absolute deviation
    max(): Largest value in array
    min(): Smallest value in array
    sma(): Signal magnitude area
    energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.
    iqr(): Interquartile range
    entropy(): Signal entropy
    arCoeff(): Autoregression coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
    correlation(): Correlation coefficient between two signals
    maxInds(): Index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
    meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
    skewness(): Skewness of the frequency domain signal
    kurtosis(): Kurtosis of the frequency domain signal
    bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
    angle(): Angle between some vectors.

## Identifiers 

    subject - The ID of the test subject
    activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
## Acitivity Labels
  
    WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test
    WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
    WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
    SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test
    STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test
    LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test
